## I approve of myself

That's a powerful statement! "I approve of myself" is more than just a phraseâ€”itâ€™s a foundation for self-compassion, confidence, and authenticity. Hereâ€™s why this mindset matters and how to nurture it:

### **Why Self-Approval Matters**  
1. **Reduces Self-Judgment**: It quietens the inner critic, allowing you to embrace imperfections as part of being human.  
2. **Builds Resilience**: When you validate yourself, external validation becomes less criticalâ€”youâ€™re less shaken by setbacks or othersâ€™ opinions.  
3. **Fosters Authenticity**: Approving yourself means honoring your values, even if they donâ€™t align with societal expectations.  

### **Challenges to Watch For**  
- **The "Imposter" Feeling**: If self-approval feels forced, pair the affirmation with action (e.g., "I approve of myself, *and* Iâ€™m learning to trust my skills").  
- **Balancing Growth**: Self-approval doesnâ€™t mean stagnation. You can love yourself *and* strive to growâ€”think "Iâ€™m enough as I am, and Iâ€™m curious about who I can become."  

### **Practices to Deepen It**  
- **Reflect**: Write down 3 things you appreciate about yourself daily (e.g., resilience, humor, effort).  
- **Act Aligned**: Make choices that reflect self-respect (e.g., setting boundaries, pursuing passions).  
- **Compassion Over Comparison**: When you notice envy, shift to: "Their light doesnâ€™t dim mine."  

### **A Reminder**  
Self-approval is a journey, not a destination. Some days itâ€™ll feel natural; other days, itâ€™ll take effort. Both are okay.
